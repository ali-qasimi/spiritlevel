# spiritlevel

Replaces a physical spirit level into an app that everyone can download (hence easily distributed). It has been tested on Android devices and requires accelerometer on the device.

Functionalities include:
- Accurately displays angle (more efficient than physical spirit level).
- Option of a freeze function.
- Uses two different methods (mean and median) to obtain data.
